# Repairs
---
Below are a number of documents that covers repairs that were done to fix issues found on different boards.  The goal of which is to hopefully provide some ideas of what to look at/for when you encounter specific issues.

Words of warning before trying to repair boards:
1.  If you have never done any (de)soldering, you should practice on a spare/parts board before doing it on the board you are trying to repair.  Videos of people (de)soldering may make it look easy, but it does require practice.  Applying to much heat can cause damage, applying to little heat and forcing it will cause damage.
2. If you feel yourself becoming impatient/frustrated, specifically around desoldering, you should stop and take a break.  Either retry later or practice some more on a parts board.  Becoming impatient often leads to applying to much force and results in damage.
3. CLEAN THE CART EDGE AND CART SLOT. Any issue that involves a cartridge (cross hatch, graphic issues, game crash, static sounds, etc) can be caused by a bad connection between the cart edge and cart slot as the result of either being dirty.  They make look clean to the eye but there can be dirty/oxidization.
