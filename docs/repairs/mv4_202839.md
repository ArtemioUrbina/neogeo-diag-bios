#### Original Condition
* Not obvious signs of damage or battery leakage


#### Symptom 1 - VRAM 32K DATA (LOWER)
Booted with diag bios and got

```
VRAM 32K DATA (LOWER)

ADDRESS:   000801
ACTUAL:    0020
EXPECTED:  0000
```

Tried multiple times and the address and actual values remained the same.

Did a quick continuity test of address/data lines, all were good.  Pulled the chip, tested in external tester, was bad.  Replaced with chip from my parts bin and retested.  ALL TESTS PASSED (include z80 tests in all slots)

#### Symptom 2 - MEMCARD DATA
My MV-IC board, memcard(s) and cables are known good.  Doing memory card tests with a 16k 8bit card I get

```
MEMCARD DATA

ADDRESS:   800000
ACTUAL:    0010
EXPECTED:  0000
```

It also is unable to detect the size of the card because of the bad data.  Tried multiple times and the address and actual values remained the same.

My memory card has its memory IC exposed so did a continuity test for the data lines between it and the 74HCT245 @ A7, which is where they go.  Found D4 was missing continuity to pin 6 on the 74HCT245.  Removed the cable and checked for continuity between pin 6 and one of the pins on the IDC connector of the cpu board, and it was there.  So this is just a connection issue between the IDC pins and my known good cables.  Cleaned the data lines related pins in the IDC connector.  Retested, memcard tests all pass.
